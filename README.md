# Brain-Tumor-Detection

Built an image classifier that looks at brain MRI scans and classifies brains with tumors and brains without tumors. Utilized transfer learning and fine tuned pretrained models (MobileNetV2, VGG16, and ResNet50). Used TensorFlow and Keras, as well as NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and Scikit-Learn.
